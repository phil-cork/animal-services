# Predicting Euthanasia in Animal Shelters

A data science project comparatively evaluating the success of city-operated animal shelters and how to predict the outcome of individual dogs entering these systems. Read the Final_Project_Report file for the best overview of the entire project.

Check out the Project Proposal to learn more about the initial ideas behind this project. For a more detailed walk through of the in-progress work that had been done, the Presentation Slides can give a general roadmap of the project up to about two weeks before completion.

The project is organized across several files to keep the code more easily digested and computationally friendly.

All of the data processing and preparation for all three datasets took place through the Data_Wrangling notebook.

The initial model evaluation and selection processed as handled in the Austin_Model_Selection notebook. Subsequently, the tuning and training of models for each different dataset was maintained in their own notebooks for clarity. Much of the process is the same for each, with the Austin-based file having additional experiments within based on its unique structure and serving as an example in the final report.

The Data_Viz notebook contains code for several of the graphics imported into the final project. The other visualizations are generated in the Modeling notebooks.

Finally, the Rmd and HTML versions of the project report are available for a comprehensive walk through of the data wrangling, model selection, model tuning, analysis, and result generating processes over the course of the entire project.
